                <p class="promo-title">Geronimo Stilton</p>
                <p>Geronimo Stilton is an Italian children's chapter book series written by Elisabetta Dami under the pen name of the title character.[1] Scholastic Corporation has published the English version of the series in the US since February 2004, and the books are published by Sweet Cherry Publishing in the UK.

                    The series is set in a fictional version of Earth dominated by anthropomorphic mice and rats and focuses on the title character, a mouse who lives in New Mouse City on Mouse Island. A best-selling author in-universe, Geronimo Stilton[2] works as editor and publisher for the newspaper The Rodent's Gazette. He has a younger sister named Thea Stilton,[3] a cousin named Trap Stilton,[3] and his favourite nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton. Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who prefers a quiet life, yet keeps getting into faraway adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin to both fictional and real locations. The books are written as fictional memoirs of him going on them and designed and distributed in full color, depicting important words in the text as colored and in illustrative typefaces.[4]

                    The series, combined with many spin-off series, has sold over 180 million copies worldwide, and with over 200 entries, it is one of the best-selling book series.[5] The books have been translated into 49 languages, with more languages in progress.[6] The series has also been adapted into an animated television series of the same name, theatrical shows, and video games.</p>
